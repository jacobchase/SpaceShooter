This document is meant to go along with the SpaceShooter package.

In SpaceShooter, the goal is to survive the numbers of enemies that are approaching your spaceship.

There are different controls in order to do these actions:
WASD/arrow keys—move around
Spacebar—shoot a laser
P-pause the game
Escape—opens a dialog box asking if you’d like to quit the game

There are multiple objectives to SpaceShooter:
Destroy as many spaceships as you possibly can in the allotted time.
Collect coins.
Add extra lives to your game, allowing you to live longer.

However, you can lose SpaceShooter by having your spaceship be destroyed!  Don’t lose all three lives or it’s game over!
